## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

Each instance in the dataset is a face image with metadata encoded in the filename.

**Filename format:** `[age]_[gender]_[race]_[date&time].jpg.chip.jpg`

Example: `39_1_0_20170116174525125.jpg.chip.jpg`
- Age: 39 years old
- Gender: 1 (Male)
- Race: 0 (White)
- Date: 20170116174525125

### Data Fields

| Field | Type | Description | Values |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| **age** | int | Person's age | 0-116 years |
| **gender** | int | Person's gender | 0 = Female, 1 = Male |
| **race** | int | Ethnicity (not used in our project) | 0 = White, 1 = Black, 2 = Asian, 3 = Indian, 4 = Others |
| **image** | PIL.Image | Face image | RGB, variable size |

### Data Splits

For our project, we created a stratified train/validation split:

| Split | Number of Images | Percentage |
|-------|------------------|------------|
| **Train** | 37,898 | 80% |
| **Validation** | 9,475 | 20% |
| **Total** | 47,373 | 100% |

**Stratification:** The split preserves the gender distribution (50/50 Female/Male).

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

UTKFace was created to provide a dataset with a wide age distribution for research in age estimation and gender classification. The images come from public sources and were manually annotated.

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection

- **Source:** Images collected from various public sources
- **Annotation:** Manual by dataset creators
- **Period:** 2017
- **Original size:** ~23,000 images

#### Data Preprocessing

**"Aligned & Cropped" version (used in this project):**

1. **Face detection:** Automatic extraction of faces
2. **Alignment:** Facial alignment based on landmarks (horizontal eyes)
3. **Cropping:** Tight crop around the face
4. **Resolution:** Variable size images (typically 200x200)

**Our additional preprocessing:**

```python
# In prepare_utkface.py
- Resizing: 112x112 pixels
- Normalization: [0, 1]
- Format: RGB
- Filtering: Removal of outlier ages (>100 years)
- Renaming: Standardized format (000001.jpg, 000002.jpg, etc.)
```

### Annotations

#### Annotation Process

- **Type:** Manual annotation by creators
- **Annotators:** Research team from University of Tennessee, Knoxville
- **Verification:** Manual quality control
- **Format:** Encoded in filename

#### Who are the annotators?

Academic research team from University of Tennessee, Knoxville, led by Zhang et al.

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

**Positive impact:**
- Advances in computer vision research
- Useful applications (photo organization, security, etc.)
- Open-source academic dataset

**Potential risks:**
- Potential biases in distribution (see limitations)
- Surveillance risks if misused
- Privacy concerns

### Discussion of Biases

#### Demographic Distribution

Our analysis of the dataset reveals:

**Gender distribution:**
```
Female (0): ~50.2% (23,758 images)
Male (1):   ~49.8% (23,615 images)
→ Relatively balanced ✅
```

**Age distribution:**
```
0-17 years:   ~15% (Young)
18-29 years:  ~35% (Young adults) ← Overrepresented
30-49 years:  ~30% (Adults)
50-69 years:  ~15% (Seniors)
70+ years:    ~5%  (Very old) ← Underrepresented
```

**⚠️ Identified biases:**

1. **Age bias:**
   - Overrepresentation of 18-40 years old
   - Underrepresentation of children (<10 years) and very elderly (>70 years)
   - **Impact:** The model may have reduced performance on extreme ages

2. **Geographic/cultural bias:**
   - Primarily Western dataset
   - Possible underrepresentation of certain ethnicities
   - **Impact:** Potentially reduced performance on underrepresented populations

3. **Image quality bias:**
   - Mostly good quality images
   - Few occlusions, difficult lighting conditions
   - **Impact:** Reduced performance in difficult real-world conditions

4. **Context bias:**
   - Images often from official photos or social media
   - Standardized expressions and poses
   - **Impact:** Limited generalization to other contexts

### Other Known Limitations

1. **Limited size:** ~23,000 images (small compared to modern datasets)
2. **Extreme ages:** Few examples >80 years or <5 years
3. **Ethnic annotations:** Simplified (5 categories), potentially inaccurate
4. **Variable resolution:** Images of different qualities
5. **Age annotations:** Potentially inaccurate (based on appearance)
