## Dataset Summary

CASIA-WebFace is a **large-scale face recognition dataset** containing **494,414 images** of **10,575 individuals**,  
collected from public celebrity photos on the web.  
Developed by the *Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Automation (CASIA)*,  
it is widely used for training and evaluating deep face recognition models.

- **Dataset Type:** Image (faces)  
- **Task:** Face classification / verification  
- **License:** Research use only (non-commercial)  
- **Size:** ~12 GB  

---

## Supported Tasks

- Face Identification (multi-class classification)  
- Face Verification (pairwise similarity)  

---

## Dataset Structure

| Split | Images | Identities | Description |
|:------|:-------|:------------|:-------------|
| Train | ~70%   | varies | Pipeline-generated split |
| Val   | ~15%   | varies | Pipeline-generated split |
| Test  | ~15%   | varies | Pipeline-generated split |

**Note:**  
The original dataset provides a suggested split, but in this project, splits are generated by the pipeline using random stratified sampling as defined in `params.yaml` (`train: 0.7`, `val: 0.15`, `test: 0.15`).  
Actual split sizes may vary depending on preprocessing and filtering steps.

**Format:** JPEG, organized by folders per person ID  
**Resolution:** 100â€“400 px typical  
**Preprocessing:** Normalization (no alignment performed in pipeline)

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

- Contains mostly celebrity images (limited demographic diversity).  
- Not suitable for biometric or surveillance applications.  
- Lighting, pose, and expression variations add realism but also challenge fairness.
